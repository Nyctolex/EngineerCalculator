# EngineerCalculator
Python modules for relevant calculations as an electrical engineer (data analysis and boring mathematical calculations).
The main purpose of those modules is to do my homework instead of me.

## LabCalculator
This module would take a given formula and derive it according to the "error function" presented in Physics lab in TAU, and generate a basic final report

## HarmonicAnalysis
This module would generate fourier coefficients of given function is Sympy
## TransystorState
This notebook contains functions that would help you analyse the state of a transistor by given sets of equations, including finding its VTC parameters, and showing full calculations.
